			It's a mental and physical game.
		</h3>
		<p class="dark">
			From a typical highschool sports player to an Olympic athlete, the physical grind of sports can often be accompanied by a heavy mental toll. But why are physical issues like injuries taken more seriously than mental issues?
		</p>
		<p>
			In today’s "win-at-all-cost" world, competitive sports drives people to work harder to reach their goals. It may seem like athletes are opting into high-stress environments to pursue their respective sports, but mental health issues are a rising problem that many elite athletes, like Michael Phelps, Simone Biles, and Naomi Osaka, have brought into conversation. Especially for young athletes, it is important to break this barrier to facilitate an open culture where athletes know it is just as important to speak about their mental health problems as it is to seek medical help for physical injuries.
